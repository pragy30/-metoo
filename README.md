* Spatial analysis for #metoo tweets from Europe * Done **

TODO:
* Repeat analysis with proper geocodes (current geocodes are not very trustworthy)
* Automate the tweet fetching process
* More representation from other continents, more time range
* Add covariates in the model, like- population to twitter users (or internet restriction), sentiments behind the tweets , etc.
